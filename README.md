# Khangmate
Khangmate App is a Bhutan-focused house rental application developed as a mini project. The platform allows users to list rental houses with pinned map locations and enables renters to easily discover available homes across Bhutan through an interactive map interface.

The app is integrated with GPS-based location services to automatically detect the user’s location, highlight nearby rental houses, and zoom the map accordingly. Users can directly chat with property owners, send booking requests, and receive approval or rejection from owners within the app.

The backend is powered by Supabase, providing authentication, real-time data handling, and secure storage for listings, bookings, and messages.
